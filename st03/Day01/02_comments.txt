1. What is a comment?
A comment in programming is a piece of text inside the code that is not treated as code.
It's just ignored.
It's used for explaining your code in human language, so that other people can read it more easily.
You can technically use it for whatever you want.

2. How do you create a comment in C++ ?
There are 2 types of comments in C++:
    2.1. One line comments.
    To create a one line comment, just put
        //
    in the beginning of a line.
    This will mark the whole line as a comment.
    Example:

                /////////////////////////////////////////
                //////// HelloWorld.cpp /////////////////
                /////////////////////////////////////////

                #include <iostream>
                using namespace std;

                // This is the main function
                int main()
                {
                    // The following line print "Hello, world!" on the console
                    cout << "Hello, world!";
                    
                    // Whatever you want to write. Doesn't matter. afdfaodfnadf09f-u2-rtfq qeaf 9-af a9v ha9 avaedv
                }

                /////////////////////////////////////////

    2.2. Multi-line comments
    To create a multi-line comment, just put
        /*
    at the beginning of your comment, and put
        */
    at the end of your comment.
    Example:

                /////////////////////////////////////////
                //////// HelloWorld.cpp /////////////////
                /////////////////////////////////////////

                #include <iostream>
                using namespace std;

                /* This is the
                main
                function */
                int main()
                {
                    /*

                Whatever you type here
                                    doesn't matter
                            daiufhnadfa9-- af9a af 9fa-
                    */
                    cout << "Hello, world!";
                }

                /////////////////////////////////////////

3. In Visual Studio Code comments are usually colored in green, so you will see them easily.
