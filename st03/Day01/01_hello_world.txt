"Hello, world!" is the classic first program to do in any programming language.
It's just a program that prints the text
    "Hello world!"
on the console.

In C++ it looks like this:




/////////////////////////////////////////
//////// HelloWorld.cpp /////////////////
/////////////////////////////////////////

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout << "Hello, world!";
}

/////////////////////////////////////////




0. It's good to be organized,
    so let's create a folder for our lessons, for example
        "CodingLessons"
    and inside of it create a folder for day 1, for example
        "Day01"

1. Open your Day01 folder in Visual Studio Code
    and create a file with a ".cpp" extension, for example
        "HelloWorld.cpp"
    Inside of it you can copy the code from above.
    (Don't forget to save the file at the end.)
    
2. Open a Terminal window.
    You can do this either in Visual Studio Code
        Terminal -> New Terminal
    or separately
        Search for "Terminal" in your applications.
        In a terminal you can use these 2 commands to navigate folders
            pwd    (print working directory, prints the directory that we're currently in)
            cd     (change directory, goes to another directory)
        Go to your Day01 folder

3. Compile your "HelloWorld.cpp" into an actual program
        g++ HelloWorld.cpp
    This will generate a file called
        a.out
    which is your final program that you can run like that
        ./a.out
    If you want another name for your program, not "a.out", you can compile like that
        g++ HelloWorld.cpp -o program
    and then run like that
        ./program




Question 1: What do you think will happen if you change
    "Hello, world!"
to
    "Noo, la polizia"
in your HelloWorld.cpp file,
save it,
and then run
    ./program
(or whatever your program is called)




Let's explain the code now. How does it work?

1. First line is
    #include <iostream>
In C++ we can include different parts of the language in our program.
This "iostream" is used for input/output to the console.
It allows us to use
    cout
    cin
and others.
We can include other stuff as well, for example
    #include <cmath>
is used for some mathematical functions.

2. Second line is
    using namespace std;
This one is not important for now,
but basically the full name of
    cout
is
    std::cout
This "std" is a namespace. All functions defined in "iostream" are in namespace "std"
so they all begin with
    std::
We can write this line
    using namespace std;
to let C++ know that we are using the "std" namespace,
and then we don't have to explicitly type
    std::cout
we can just type
    cout

3. Third line is    (not counting empty lines)
    int main()
Together with the opening and closing braces
    {
        ...
    }
it forms the "main function".
This is the starting point of your program.
Whatever code is written between the braces {}
will be executed when you run the program.

4. Fourth line is    ( not counting braces {} )
    cout << "Hello, world!";
This is the line that actually prints "Hello, world!" on the console.
