For C++ development we need 2 things:

1. A C++ compiler
    1.1. What is a compiler?
    1.2. Install gcc
        Check if you have brew installed
            brew --version
        If not, install it
            /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
        It will give you 2 commands that look like
            echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zprofile
            eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
        Copy and run them, one by one.
        Verify that brew is installed successfully
            brew --version
        If it did, you can use it to install gcc
            brew install gcc
        Verify that gcc is installed successfully
            gcc --version
            g++ --version
        
2. Visual Studio Code
    2.1. What is Visual Studio Code?
    2.2. Install from official site.
    2.3. Inside of it, install the C++ extension

That's it.
