1. What is an "if statement" ?
An if statement is a way execute a piece of code only if some condition is met.

2. How to use an if statement?
    if ( *condition* )
    {
        *piece of code*
    }
Example:
    int x = 5;
    if (x > 1)
    {
        cout << "x is greater than 1";
    }
    ----
    Result: x is greater than 1
Example:
    int x = 5;
    if (x < 1)
    {
        cout << "x is less than 1";
    }
    ----
    Result: *nothing*

3. What exactly can be the condition?
You can compare numbers using these 6 operators
    >        greater than
    <        less than
    ==       equals
    !=       not equals
    >=       greater than or equals
    <=       less than or equals
Example:
    2 < 3    true
    2 > 3    false
    3 > 2    true
    3 > 3    false
    3 >= 3   true
    3 <= 3   true
    1 <= 3   true
    5 <= 3   false
    5 == 5   true
    5 == 2   false
    5 != 2   true
    2 != 2   false
You can compare characters with
    ==       equals
    !=       not equals
Example:
    'c' == 'c'    true
    'c' == 'b'    false
    'c' != 'b'    true
    'c' != 'c'    false
You can combine multiple conditions in one, using these 2 operators
    &&    and
    ||    or
Example:
    5 > 1 && 5 > 2     true
    5 > 1 && 5 == 1    false
    5 > 1 || 5 > 2     true
    5 > 1 || 5 == 1    true
    5 < 1 || 5 == 1    false

4. What is "else" ?
"else" can be used to execute some other piece of code,
in case the condition is NOT met.
    if ( *condition* )
    {
        *some piece of code*
    }
    else
    {
        *another piece of code*
    }
Example:
    int x = 5;
    if (x < 1)
    {
        cout << "apple";
    }
    else
    {
        cout << "banana";
    }
    ----
    Result: banana
