1. What is a vector in C++?
- A vector is a list of multiple values
        For example: 3, 5, -12, 91341
  We call these values the "elements" of the vector.
- Similar to a variable, but instead of holding a single value, it can hold a list of values
- All elements in a vector must be of the same type.
        For example you can have a vector of int values:
                6, 1, 33, 0
        or you can have a vector of char values:
                'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'
        or you can have a vector of bool values:
                true, true, false, true, false
        or you can have a vector of float values:
                3.14, 0.2, 10.413413
        but you CANNOT have a vector of mixed int values and bool values:
                4, 5, true, 0, false, -12


To use vectors in C++ we have to first include the "vector" capability of C++ in the beginning of our program:
        #include <vector>


2. How to create a vector?
- a vector of int values:
        vector<int> v = { 3, 7, 9, 0, -3 };
- a vector of float values:
        vector<float> v = { 3.14, 0.02, -5.0 }
- a vector of bool values:
        vector<bool> v = { true, false, false, false };
- a vector of char values:
        vector<char> v = { 'd', 'o', 'g' };


3. What is an index?
An index is a way of talking about a specific element of a vector.
It's like saying
        "the first element in a vector"
or
        "the third element in a vector"
or
        "the one hundred fifty sixth element in a vector"
If we have a vector like this
        vector<int> v = { 5, 1, 3, -2, 57 };
elements are indexed (numbered) starting from 0          <--- IMPORTANT
        0   1   2   3    4         <--- index
        5,  1,  3,  -2,  57        <--- element
For example,
        the element with index 0 is 5    (or the 0th element)
        the element with index 3 is -2   (or the 3rd element)
        etc.


4. How to access an individual element of a vector?
- We use the index, together with square brackets []
        v[0] - the 0th element    (the element with index 0 from vector v)
        v[5] - the 5th element    (the element with index 5 from vector v)
        etc.
- For example, if we have this vector
        vector<int> v = { 12, 5, -2, 0, 9 }
    then
        v[0] is 12
        v[1] is 5
        v[2] is -2
        v[3] is 0
        v[4] is 9
- Once we access an element like that, we can use it as if it's a variable,
    we can print it
        cout << v[0];
    do maths with it
        int x = v[1] + v[2];
    or even set a new value to it
        v[3] = 2852875;



Exercise 1: What will be printed?
        vector<int> v = { 4, 2, 0, 3, 7, -2, -5 };
        cout << v[1] + v[4] << endl;

Exercise 2: What will be printed?
        vector<int> v = { 4, 1, 7 };
        cout << v[0] + v[1] + v[2] << endl;
        v[1] = 0;
        cout << v[0] + v[1] + v[2] << endl;

Exercise 3: What will be printed?
        vector<int> v = { 2, -2 };
        cout << v[0] + v[1] << endl;
        v[0] = v[1];
        v[1] = v[0];
        cout << v[0] + v[1] << endl;

Exercise 4: What will be printed?
        vector<int> a = { 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 };
        vector<int> b = { 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 };
        cout << a[1] + b[1] << endl;
        a[0] = b[4] + 8;
        cout << a[0] * 2 << endl;
        b[0] += a[0];
        cout << b[0] << endl;


5. How to add an element to a vector?
Once you have created a vector you can continue adding elements to it later in your code.
Let's say you have this vector
        vector<int> v = { 4, 7, 1 };
and you want to add the number 9 to it.
You can use the function
    push_back()
like this:
        v.push_back(9);
After doing this the vector will look like:
        { 4, 7, 1, 9 }


Exercise 5: What will be printed?
        vector<int> v = { 4, 1, 7 };
        cout << v[2] << endl;
        v.push_back(2);
        cout << v[3] << endl;
        v.push_back(9);
        v.push_back(8);
        cout << v[0] + v[5] << endl;

Exercise 6: Find the mistake:
        vector<int> v = { 9, 9, 9 };
        cout << v[2] << endl;
        v.push_back(8);
        cout << v[3] + v[4] << endl;
        v.push_back(7);
        cout << v[4] << endl;


6. How to get a vector's size?
What is a vector's size? It's just the number of elements that it contains.
If you have a vector
        vector<int> v = { 3, 9, 8, 1 }
you can get its size like this:
        v.size()
In this case v.size() will be 4 because v contains 4 elements.


Exercise 7: What will be printed?
        vector<int> v = { 3, 3, 8, 1, 6 };
        cout << v.size() << endl;
        v.push_back(41);
        cout << v.size() << endl;


Exercise 8: What will be printed?
        vector<int> a = { 3, 3, 8, 1, 6 };
        vector<int> b = { 99, 88, 77 };
        b.push_back(a.size());
        a.push_back(a.size());
        a.push_back(a.size());
        a.push_back(a.size());
        cout << a.size() << endl;
At the end of this program how can you print the last element of a?


Exercise 9: What will be printed?
            Explain in simple terms what f() does.
---------------------------------------------------------
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

vector<int> v = { 4, 5, 6 };

void f()
{
    int last = v[v.size() - 1];
    v.push_back(last + 1);
}

int main()
{
    f();
    f();
    f();
    f();
    cout << v[6] + v.size() << endl;
}
---------------------------------------------------------


7. How to loop over a vector?
We can use a while loop to do something with each element of a list.
If we have a vector
        vector<...> v = { ... };
we can do something with each element, like this:
        int i = 0;
        while (i < v.size())
        {
            * do something with v[i] *
            i++;
        }
For example here is a program that prints all numbers from a vector:
        vector<int> v = { 3, 8, 1, 2, 2, 4, 9, 9, 1, 5, 2, 6, 8, 4, 1, 6, 6, 8, 0, 1 };
        int i = 0;
        while (i < v.size())
        {
            cout << v[i] << endl;
            i++;
        }
Here is a program that increases each number from a vector by one, and then prints all the numbers:
        vector<int> v = { 3, 8, 1, 2, 2, 4, 9, 9, 1, 5, 2, 6, 8, 4, 1, 6, 6, 8, 0, 1 };
        int i = 0;
        while (i < v.size())
        {
            v[i]++;
            i++;
        }
        i = 0;
        while (i < v.size())
        {
            cout << v[i] << endl;
            i++;
        }
    (What will be printed?)
Here is a program that fills a vector with the numbers from 1 to 100
        vector<int> v;
        int i = 0;
        while (i < v.size())
        {
            v.push_back(i + 1);
            i++;
        }
