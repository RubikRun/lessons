What we learned so far


0. Setup
- How to compile a console program:
        g++ HelloWorld.cpp
    Then you can run it like this:
        (on Mac):        ./a.out
        (on Windows):    a.exe
- How to compile a graphics program:
    (on Mac):        g++ main.cpp -o game -I/opt/homebrew/include -L/opt/homebrew/lib -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system -std=c++17
    (on Windows):    g++ main.cpp -o game.exe -IC:/dev/libs/SFML/include -LC:/dev/libs/SFML/lib -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system -std=c++17



1. cout
    cout << "some text";
    cout << x;
    cout << endl;


2. variables
- types of variables:
    int, float, char, bool
- how to create a variable?
    int x = 5;
    float y = 0.13;
    char c = 'T';
    bool b = false;


3. cin
- getting input from user
    int x;
    cin >> x;


4. if, else, else if
- how to use it?
    if ( *condition* )
    {
        *piece of code*
    }
    else if ( *condition* )
    {
        *piece of code*
    }
    else
    {
        *piece of code*
    }


5. Conditions
- You can compare values using these 6 operators
    >        greater than
    <        less than
    ==       equals
    !=       not equals
    >=       greater than or equals
    <=       less than or equals
- You can combine comparisons using these 2 operators
    &&       and
    ||       or


6. while
- Repeats something, until a conditions stops being true
    while ( *condition* )
    {
        *piece of code*
    }
- Example: Go up from 0 to 10:
    int x = 0;
    while (x <= 10)
    {
        ...
        x++;
    }
- Example: Go down from 10 to 0:
    int x = 10;
    while (x >= 0)
    {
        ...
        x--;
    }


7. Functions
- A piece of code that you give a name to
        void *name*()
        {
            *piece of code*
        }
  Example:
        void sayHi()                             // The name is "sayHi"
        {
            cout << "Hi" << endl;
        }
- A function can be called by typing its name followed by ()
  Example:
        int main()
        {
            sayHi();                             // Calling sayHi 3 times
            sayHi();
            sayHi();
        }
- A function can return a result.
  There are different types of functions depending on what type of result they return.
        void  -  doesn't return anything
        int   -  returns an integer (whole number)
        bool  -  returns a boolean (true or false)
        char  -  returns a character
  Example:
        int f()                                // f is an int function
        {
            int x = 5;
            int y = 8;
            return x + y + 2;                  // 15 will be returned
        }
  When you call a function, it will be replaced by whatever it returns.
  Example:
            int main()
            {
                cout << f() << endl;
            }
      f is called, it returns 15, so "f()" is replaced by 15.
      Same as having this program instead:
            int main()
            {
                cout << 15 << endl;
            }
  Example:
            int main()
            {
                int x = f() - 9;
                cout << x << endl;
            }
      f is called, it returns 15, so "f()" is replaced by 15.
      Same as having this program instead:
            int main()
            {
                int x = 15 - 9;
                cout << x << endl;
            }
