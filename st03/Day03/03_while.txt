1. What is a while loop?
A while loop allows you to repeat a piece of code multiple times
until a certain condition stops being true


2. How to write a while loop?
    while ( *condition* )
    {
        *piece of code*
    }
Similar to an if statement,
but it will keep repeating the piece of code
until the condition stops being true.

    int x = 1;
    while (x <= 10)
    {
        cout << x << endl;
        x += 1;
    }
