What we learned so far


0. Setup
- how to compile a .cpp file with g++?
    g++ HelloWorld.cpp
This command produces a file called
    a.out
which is the final program. You can run it like this:
    ./a.out


1. cout
- printing text:
    cout << "some text";
- printing a variable:
    cout << x;
- printing a new line
    cout << endl;
- printing multiple things together:
    cout << "I am " << age << " years old." << endl;


2. variables
- types of variables:
    int, float, char, bool
- how to create a variable?
    int x = 5;
    float y = 0.13;
    char c = 'T';
    bool b = false;


3. cin
- getting input from user
    int x;
    cin >> x;


4. if, else, else if
- how to use it?
    if ( *condition* )
    {
        *piece of code*
    }
    else if ( *condition* )
    {
        *piece of code*
    }
    else
    {
        *piece of code*
    }


5. Conditions
- You can compare values using these 6 operators
    >        greater than
    <        less than
    ==       equals
    !=       not equals
    >=       greater than or equals
    <=       less than or equals
- You can combine comparisons using these 2 operators
    &&       and
    ||       or
