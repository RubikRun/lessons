Here is a program that prints numbers from 1 to 100:
====================================================
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int x = 1;
    while (x <= 100)
    {
        cout << x << endl;
        x++;
    }
}
====================================================

Can you compile and run it? Here's how to do it:

1. Open Visual Studio Code

2. Open your folder    (the folder we used for all our programs so far).
                        Hint: Look for an "Open Folder" button.
                              See image 01.01.png

3. Create a new file
                        Hint: On the left side you should see all files in your folder
                              Above them there are 4 buttons. The first one is for creating a new file.
                              See image 01.02.png
   Name your new file like this:
       hw0601.cpp                (because it's homework for day 06 problem 01)
   or whatever name you want     (has to end in .cpp)

4. Copy the code from above and paste it in your new file

5. Open a terminal in your folder
                        Hint: On the top-most ribbon there is a Terminal menu
                              First option there is New Terminal.
                              See image 01.03.png

6. Compile your file by running this command in the terminal:
        g++ hw0601.cpp
                        (if you called your file something else, put your file's name instead of hw0601.cpp)

7. After compiling you can finally run your program by running this command:
        ./a.out

If you ran it succesfully you should see numbers from 1 to 100 each on a new line.

====================================================

Your task now is to modify this program
so that it first prints the numbers from 1 to 50 and then the numbers from 20 to 80.
When you run it you should see this:
1
2
3
...
49
50
20
21
22
...
79
80

Whenever you change the code and you want to run the program again don't forget to do this:
1. Save your file
2. Compile the program again
        g++ hw0601.cpp
3. Then you can run it
        ./a.out
