What we learned so far


0. Setup
- compile:
    g++ HelloWorld.cpp
produces a file:
    a.out    (a.exe on Windows)
which you can run:
    ./a.out    (a.exe on Windows)


1. cout
    cout << "some text";
    cout << x;
    cout << endl;


2. variables
- types of variables:
    int, float, char, bool
- how to create a variable?
    int x = 5;
    float y = 0.13;
    char c = 'T';
    bool b = false;


3. cin
- getting input from user
    int x;
    cin >> x;


4. if, else, else if
- how to use it?
    if ( *condition* )
    {
        *piece of code*
    }
    else if ( *condition* )
    {
        *piece of code*
    }
    else
    {
        *piece of code*
    }


5. Conditions
- You can compare values using these 6 operators
    >        greater than
    <        less than
    ==       equals
    !=       not equals
    >=       greater than or equals
    <=       less than or equals
- You can combine comparisons using these 2 operators
    &&       and
    ||       or


6. while
- Repeats something, until a conditions stops being true
    while ( *condition* )
    {
        *piece of code*
    }
- Go up from 0 to 10:
    int x = 0;
    while (x <= 10)
    {
        ...
        x++;
    }
- Go down from 10 to 0:
    int x = 10;
    while (x >= 0)
    {
        ...
        x--;
    }


7. To compile an SFML program:
    (on Mac): g++ main.cpp -o game -I/opt/homebrew/include -L/opt/homebrew/lib -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system
    (on Windows): g++ main.cpp -o game.exe -IC:/dev/libs/SFML/include -LC:/dev/libs/SFML/lib -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system
To run it:
    (On Mac): ./game
    (On Windows): game.exe
