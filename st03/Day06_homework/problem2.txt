Imagine Andres is running a churrer√≠a (a place that sells churros).
Until now his pricing was the following:
    - 1 churro  for 3$    (expensive, i know)
    - 2 churros for 6$
    - 3 churros for 9$
    - 4 churros for 12$
    etc.
basically clients paid 3$ per churro.
Simple, right?
You wrote this program for him to help him with calculating the price of an order:
=========================================================================
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout << "Enter number of churros: ";
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    cout << "Price: " << n * 3 << endl;
}
=========================================================================

Can you compile and run it?
Create a new file, you can call it:
    hw0602.cpp
Then copy the code above and paste it in the new file.
Compile and run        (as shown in problem1.txt)
Try running it a few times, entering different number of churros, make sure you understand how it works.


Your first task here is a small one:
Right now the program prints for example this:
    Price: 15
We want it to print this:
    Price: 15$
Adding a dollar sign after the number.
Can you modify the code to do this?


Your second task is:
Andres decides to change his pricing.
If an order is 4 churros or less then the pricing is the same:
    - 1 churro  for 3$
    - 2 churros for 6$
    - 3 churros for 9$
    - 4 churros for 12$
But if an order is 5 churros or more then each new churro is 2$ instead of 3$:
    - 5 churros for 14$
    - 6 churros for 16$
    - 7 churros for 18$
    - 8 churros for 20$
    etc.
Can you modify the code to calculate the price based on this new pricing?
        Hint: If n is less than or equal to 4 do the same as now.
              Otherwise the price should be 12$ plus the number of "additional" churros times 2$.
              "Additional" churros are the ones after the 4th one,
              so if the order is 6 churros then you have 2 additional ones.
              If the order is 10 churros then you have 6 additional ones.

At the end you should get a program that asks you to enter number of churros
and then tells you the price based on the new pricing
with a dollar sign at the end.
Don't forget to test it - compile, run a few times and verify that it works.
