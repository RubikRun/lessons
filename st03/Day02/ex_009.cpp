// Exercise 9:
// Imagine we have a chessboard.
// Let's put it on the wall and play darts on it.
// The goal of the game is to throw a dart and land inside of this area marked in red.
// (see image ex_009_chessboard.png)
//
// Imagine we have some device that automatically detects the coordinates where the dart lands.
// For example you throw it, and it detects
//     x = 3
//     y = 1
// These are the coordinates of the square where the dart landed.
// Did we hit the target area?
//
// Create a program where the user can enter 2 numbers,
// the 2 coordinates of the square,
// and the program tells them if they hit the target.
//
//     Example:
// Program:    Where did the dart land?
// User:       5
//             5
// Program:    You hit the target!
//
//    Example:
// Program:    Where did the dart land?
// User:       3
//             8
// Program:    You missed!
