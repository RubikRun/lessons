// Exercise 8:
// Create a program that asks for your score on a test.
// (score is a whole number 0 to 100)
// Then it tells you your grade (A, B, C, D or F).
// - A is for scores 90 to 100
// - B is for scores 80 to 89
// - C is for scores 60 to 79
// - D is for scores 30 to 59
// - F is for scores 0 to 29
// If you enter an invalid score (not 0 to 100) it should tell you.
//
//     Example:
// Program:    What's your score?
// User:       87
// Program:    You got a B.
//
//     Example:
// Program:    What's your score?
// User:       1
// Program:    You got an F.
//
//     Example:
// Program:    What's your score?
// User:       164
// Program:    That's not a valid score.
